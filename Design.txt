Reflect on My Design

1. What additional properties did you add to your model and why?

- I've added score property on User's model in order to display the user rankings.
- I've added current_player property on Game's model in order to know which player needs to make a move.
- I've added board property on Game's model in order to keep track of the moves that have been made in the game.
- I've added cancelled property on Game's model in order to determine is a game has been cancelled or not.
- I've added email_reminder_sent property on Game's model in order to send (via cron) only once an email to a user that
 has played in a cancelled game.
- When a game ends and is not a draw I update User's score.

2. What were some of the trade-offs or struggles you faced when implementing the new game logic?

- In order to create a new game I needed to understand really good how Guess A Number worked, so
  I created a frontend for Guess a Number and played a little bit with it until I had a clear imagine
  what the game was doing.
- That's why I implemented a frontend for Tic Tac Toe, because when you have all the parts, the interaction
  between the frontend and the backend it's more pleasant and it makes you think more of edge cases.
